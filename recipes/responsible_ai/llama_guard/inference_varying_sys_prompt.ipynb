    "Welcome to this  notebook where we explore the customization of Llama Guard for specific application needs. Llama Guard, a versatile AI safety tool, can be adapted to enhance its performance and relevance in various scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start with zero-shot prompting, a powerful method that allows Llama Guard to make predictions without prior explicit examples. This technique is particularly useful for initial explorations and quick setups. As we progress, we'll delve into adding and removing safety categories before touching on fine-tuning processes, where we adjust Llama Guard's parameters to better align with our specific data and use cases. By the end of this notebook, you'll have a solid understanding of how to tailor Llama Guard effectively, ensuring it performs optimally for your unique requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Taxonomy\n",
    "\n",
    "Llama Guard is provided with a reference taxonomy explained on [this page](https://llama.meta.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/meta-llama-guard-2), where the prompting format is also explained. \n",
    "\n",
    "The functions below combine already existing [prompt formatting code in llama-recipes](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes/blob/main/src/llama_recipes/inference/prompt_format_utils.py) with custom code to aid in the custimization of the taxonomy. "
